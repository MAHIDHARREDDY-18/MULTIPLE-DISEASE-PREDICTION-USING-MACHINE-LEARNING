# 🩺 Multiple Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Multiple Disease Prediction System**, an AI-powered healthcare assistant designed to help predict the likelihood of **Diabetes**, **Heart Disease**, **Parkinson’s Disease**, and **Breast Cancer** using advanced Machine Learning algorithms.

This project aims to assist users in early detection of these diseases and raise health awareness through a web-based interface.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This system leverages machine learning models trained on real-world medical datasets to accurately predict various diseases based on user-inputted symptoms and test results. The goal is to make medical insights more accessible, especially in remote and under-resourced areas.
